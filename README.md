This code reads the Samsung data set from a set of folders found in UCI HAR Dataset directory of the working directory.  The code reads the X, y and subject files from both the train and test subfolders.  Additionally the file uses the file files features.txt and activity_labels.txt to provide the names for the columns and the activities.  These files should be in the UCI HAR Dataset directory.
